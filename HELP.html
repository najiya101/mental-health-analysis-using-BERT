        <h1>Help - Depression Assessment</h1>
        
        <p>Welcome to the Depression Assessment page. This is a confidential and anonymous questionnaire designed to help you understand your mental well-being and recognize symptoms of depression. Please read through the instructions below to help you navigate the questions.</p>

        <h2>How to Fill Out the Questionnaire:</h2>

        <p>This questionnaire consists of several questions that ask about your feelings, thoughts, and behaviors over the past week. Each question has multiple options with a range of responses that will help assess your emotional state. Here's how to proceed:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Multiple Choice Options:</strong> Each question will provide a set of radio buttons for you to choose from. Select the option that best represents how you have felt recently. You can only select one option per question.</li>
            <li><strong>Be Honest:</strong> This assessment is designed to help you understand your mental health better, so it’s important to answer truthfully. Your responses are completely anonymous and will not be shared.</li>
            <li><strong>Feel Free to Take Your Time:</strong> There’s no rush. Answer each question thoughtfully, and don’t feel pressured to hurry through the survey.</li>
            <li><strong>If You Feel Uncertain:</strong> If you are unsure about how to answer a question, take a moment to reflect on how you’ve been feeling recently, and choose the answer that best aligns with your emotions during the past week.</li>
            <li><strong>Required Questions:</strong> Some questions are marked with an asterisk (*) to indicate that they are required. You won’t be able to submit the form until you’ve answered these questions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Common Questions:</h2>

        <h3>Why are there multiple options for each question?</h3>
        <p>Each question is designed to capture the range of emotions and experiences that people may have. The options allow you to express the level of intensity of your feelings. For example, some questions range from feeling "not at all" to "very frequently," allowing for more nuanced responses.</p>

        <h3>What should I do if I feel upset while answering the questions?</h3>
        <p>If you find yourself feeling upset or distressed while filling out the questionnaire, it’s important to stop and take a break. Take a moment to breathe and relax. If you feel the need, consider talking to a trusted friend, family member, or a professional counselor. Remember that your mental well-being is important, and this questionnaire is here to help you, not to harm you.</p>

        <h3>What happens after I submit the assessment?</h3>
        <p>Once you have completed the assessment, you will receive feedback based on your answers. This feedback will provide insight into your current emotional state and may suggest next steps or additional resources that could be helpful.</p>

        <h3>Is my information confidential?</h3>
        <p>Yes, your responses are completely anonymous. No personal identifying information is collected, and your answers will be used solely for providing feedback to help assess your mental health.</p>
